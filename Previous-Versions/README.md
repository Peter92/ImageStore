<h4>Summaries:</h4>

<h5>Version 1:</h5>

It works, but I manually wrote the conversion code which is very slow and inefficient, making any large amounts of data impossible to work with.

<h5>Version 2:</h5>

I rewrote everything using a lot of inbuilt Python features, the result is a lot faster and extremely lightweight.

<h5>Version 3:</h5>

This is the current version, with support for custom images, uploading, and more.
